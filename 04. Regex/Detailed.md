# Lab 04. Detailed - Regex

- One of these strings contains the character 'ά' (Greek lower case acute alpha). Using the -match operator, set the string containing this character to the variable $MyString

*Notice:* You can also get the strings by running the command

```PowerShell
$Text = Get-Content '.\04. Regex\sentence.txt'
```

```powershell

'A pangram (Greek: παν γραμμα, pan gramma, "every letter")' -match 'π'

# Or if you import the text useing the text file:
$MyString = $text -match 'ot'

$Matches

```

- In this string there are recurring patterns of between 1 and 6 '§' characters. Using the -replace operator, 
replace each occurrence with one newline

```Powershell
$MyString = $MyString -replace '§+',"`n"
```

---

- Using `Select-String`, find all text in the variable matching a word boundary in the `$MyString` variable

```Powershell
Select-String -InputObject $MyString -Pattern '\w' -AllMatches
```

*Notice: A word boundary includes any alphanumeric character, but no punctuation.*

---

- Using `Select-String`, find all characters in the English alphabet in the `$MyString` variable

```Powershell
Select-String -InputObject $MyString -Pattern '[a-zA-Z]+' -AllMatches
```

*Notice: The range operators a-z and A-Z are case sensitive, and will not match any Unicode characters.*

---

- Using the `[regex]` class, find all words written with Greek letters in the `$MyString` variable

```Powershell
$Pattern = '\p{IsGreek}+'
$AllMatches = [regex]::Matches($MyString, $Pattern)
$AllMatches.Value
```

*Notice: \p is the constructor for many different Unicode characters, such as \p{Ll} which matches any lower case, and \p{LL} which matches any upper case Unicode character.*

---

- Using `Select-String`, find all words ending a sentence (words that end with a .) in the `$MyString` variable

```Powershell
Select-String -InputObject $MyString -Pattern '[^\s0-9]+\.' -AllMatches
```

Explanation:

```PowerShell
[ # Start match character in group
  ^ # Negated group, Any character not in the following list
  \s # Any whitespace character
  0-9 # Any number between 0 and 9
] # End match character in group
  + # Quantifier, one or more of the previous (in this case, the capturegroup)
  \. # Literal dot '.'
```

- The last 6 lines in the $MyString sentence are random variations of pangrams. Using the `[regex]` class and capture groups, create custom objects with:
  - The line order (1 - 6) in which the lines are sorted right now
  - The text of the line without '"'
  - The length of the line, as specified in the parenthesis ("28 letters")
- Sort the resulting list of custom objects by length of the sentence

```Powershell
$Pattern = '(?<Line>[0-9])\.\s{1}"(?<Text>[^("]*)"\s\((?<PhraseLength>[\d]{2})'
$AllMAtches = [regex]::Matches($MyString, $Pattern)
$ResultObject = $AllMatches | ForEach-Object {
    [pscustomobject]@{
        'Line' = $_.Groups['Line'].Value
        'Text' = $_.Groups['Text'].Value
        'PhraseLength' =  $_.Groups['PhraseLength'].Value
    }
}
$ResultObject | Sort-Object -Property PhraseLength
```

Explanation:

```Powershell
'1. "Jived fox nymph grabs quick waltz." (28 letters)'

# ( # Start of capture group 1
#     ?<Line> # Named capture group 'Line'
#     [ # Start match character in list
#         0-9 # Any number between 0 and 9
#     ] # End match character in list
# ) # End of capture group 1
'1'

# \. # Literal '.'
'.'

# \s # Any whitespace character
#     {1} # Quantifier, exactly one time
' '

# " # Literal '"'
'"'

# ( # Start of capture group 2
#     ?<Text> # Named capture group 'Text'
#     [^ # Start match character _not_ in list
#         ( # Literal '("
#         " # Literal '"'
#     ] # End match character _not_ in list
#     * # Quantifier, between zero and unlimited
# ) # End of capture group 2
'Jived fox nymph grabs quick waltz.'

# " # Literal '"'
'"'

# \s # Any whitespace character
' '

# \(  # Literal '('
'('

# ( # Start of capture group 3
#     ?<PhraseLength> # Named capture group 'PhraseLength'
#     [ # Start match character in list
#         \d # Any digit (equal to [0-9])
#     ] # End match character in list
#     {2} # Quantifier, exactly two times
# ) # End of capture group 3
'28'
