# Lab 04. Regex

- One of these strings contains the character 'ά' (Greek lower case acute alpha). Using the -match operator,
 set the string containing this character to the variable `$MyString`

*Notice:* You can also get the strings by running the command

```PowerShell
$Text = Get-Content '\PowerShellAdvancedFundamentals\04. Regex\sentence.txt'
$Text = Get-Content '.\04. Regex\sentence.txt'
```

```powershell
$text = 'A pangram (Greek: παν γραμμα, pan gramma, "every letter") or holoalphabetic sentence is a sentence using every letter 
of a given alphabet at least once. §An example from German is:§§§§§"Victor jagt zwölf Boxkämpfer quer über den großen
Sylter Deich."§§§The following are examples of pangrams that are shorter than "The quick brown fox jumps over 
a lazy dog".§§§    1. "The five boxing wizards jump quickly." (31 letters)§§§§    2. "Glib jocks quiz nymph to vex dwarf." (28 letters)§§§§§    
   3. "Jived fox nymph grabs quick waltz."(28 letters)§§§    4. "Pack my box with five dozen liquor jugs." (32 letters)§§§§§§ 
         5. "How vexingly quick daft zebras jump!" (30 letters§§§ 6. "Sphinx of black quartz, judge my vow." (29 letters)§§'
```

$MyString = $Text -match 'ά'
$str = 'hej jag heter Tobbe'

$str -match 'tobbe'



-replace '§+',"`n"


$Matches
---

- In this string there are recurring patterns of between 1 and 6 '§' characters. 
Using the -replace operator, replace each occurrence with one newline

$text -replace '§+',"`n" 
---

- Using `Select-String`, find all text in the variable matching a word boundary in the `$MyString` variable

---

- Using `Select-String`, find all characters in the English alphabet in the `$MyString` variable

Select-String -InputObject $Text -Pattern '[a-zA-Z]+' -AllMatches

---

- Using the `[regex]` class, find all words written with Greek letters in the `$MyString` variable



---

- Using `Select-String`, find all words ending a sentence (words that end with a .) in the `$MyString` variable

Select-String -InputObject $Text -Pattern '[*.]' -AllMatches
Select-String -InputObject $text -Pattern '[^\s0-9]+\.' -AllMatches


---

- The last 6 lines in the `$MyString` sentence are random variations of pangrams. Using the `[regex]` class and capture groups, create custom objects with:
  - The line order (1 - 6) in which the lines are sorted right now
  - The text of the line without '"'
  - The length of the line, as specified in the parenthesis ("28 letters")
- Sort the resulting list of custom objects by length of the sentence
